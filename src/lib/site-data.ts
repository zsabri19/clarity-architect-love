          "In stable conditions, leadership style is largely cosmetic — the system absorbs the difference. Under pressure the system stops absorbing anything, and every decision routes through the leader's default behaviour. That is why crisis is a forced audit: systems reveal what breaks and what holds, and people reveal who acts and who stalls.",
          "The mistake most leadership development makes is treating style as identity. It is not. Style is a setting. The discipline is knowing which setting the current condition requires, and having the range to change it without losing your own compass — shifting tempo while holding the same melody.",

          "Directive. Used when ambiguity is the primary cost and someone must name the frame. Directive leadership is legitimate only for as long as clarity is genuinely missing; held longer, it manufactures the dependency it was meant to remove.",
          "Diagnostic. The style that resists the urge to act. It asks what is missing rather than what is broken, because the real question in a stalled organisation is rarely what's broken — it's what's missing.",
          "Architectural. This is the style that builds structure instead of managing symptoms. Governance is not a brake; it is the accelerator, and the architectural leader installs it as a roadmap rather than a control layer.",
          "Coaching. The human infrastructure of change. Performance requires psychological safety before execution, and coaching is the only style that produces safety at the speed a transformation needs.",
          "Delegating. Once trust is earned, the failure mode is micro-correction. Teams don't grow when we constantly override their thinking; they grow when we trust them to think, to act, to lead.",
          "Interpretive. The style that translates technology into human terms. Technology becomes transformation only when leaders act as interpreters — embedding innovation into systems, and into the lives of the people who will live with it every day.",

Control and Capability call for architectural leadership. Calibration and Correction depend on interpretive and coaching behaviour. Continuity and Coaching demand delegation, because governance that outlives its champion is the only governance that counts.",
          "Sequencing errors are the most expensive leadership mistake in transformation. Delegating before clarity exists produces silos — silos aren't created by ego, they feel safe when clarity is missing. Architecting before capability exists produces compliance theatre.

A players are risk-takers and challengers who thrive under pressure. B players present as A players while taking credit for C-level work.",
          "In crisis this matters because style range is concentrated in A players. A leadership team stacked with B players will default to a single style regardless of condition, and the organisation will read that rigidity as the crisis itself.",

Installing it means three things: decision rights that are legible without escalation, correction architecture built before your assumptions fail, and leaders who build systems rather than leaders who fight fires.",
